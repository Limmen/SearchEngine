# SearchEngine

## What is it?
This is a project created in a course on Algorithms and datastructures.
The program is written in Java and represents a SearchEngine which at startup will read 500 documents and their containing words, when the reading is done the user will be notified (taks around 4seconds) that he/she can search for words.


##Functionality
The search-queries is handled by a parsetree that supports complex queries in infix-notation.
Supported operations are: Union (|), Intersection (+) and Difference (-).

The result will contain the documents where the words occur. The documents can be sorted by adding: "sortby popularity/relevance asc/desc"

##Documentation
The code is well documented but if you have any questions you can contact me on Kimham@kth.se
